#Create a Bare Bones Cataloing Medule, Part 2

## Notes from Week 9 assignment

###### Goals
* Create a cataloging directory in var/www/html
* Create a index.html file in new directory
* Create insert.php file in new directory
* Secure cataloging directory with htpasswd command
* add additional records using new web form
* use OPAC to serach and retreive new records

Note to self: try not to get so anxious everytime Dr. Burns says 'type this really carefully or you could break something'
**Anixety sky rockets anyway**

Pat on the back for achieving this week's assignment way earlier than you ever have.

Remember not to edit the php script!

Cataloging form works *GREAT* and is now password protected. Remember password is a **double test**. Don't forget.
Username is libcat
