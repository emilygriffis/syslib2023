#Create a Bare Bones OPAC, Part1

##Notes from week 8 assignments

######Goals
* Recreate HTML and PHP files with provided code
* Login to MySQL from command line and add five records to books db
* Test new OPAC
* Journal/document the process

This week was going pretty smoothly until the very end!! **BAH**

I was able to set up opacbb.html and access the page that allows me to search my opac. But *ALAS*, when I tried to search I broke Google.

Dr. Burns helped me figure it out! Remember in the future- *DO NOT* edit the php file, only the html file.

I deleted the php file, use sudo or it won't let you, and create a new file with the same name. Copy and paste code without editing, then search the OPAC to your heart's content.

REMMEBER THIS FOR NEXT WEEK! Do less not more.
