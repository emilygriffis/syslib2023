#Library Site Architecture
##Notes for class weeks 14-15

#####Goals:
* Connect everything!
* Wordpress is home page, omeka is digital library, koha is library catalog

I've decided to theme my page as a library for cats- the Purrfect County Public Library for Cats. 
I created a logo and banner on Canva and wrote a basic description on the home page.
The digital archives is a photo archive of "the founders" of Purrfect County- i.e. my first cats
I'll write a fake mission and vision on the about page of wordpress
I plan to catalog books that are all cat related on koha


Notes: all login info for admin sides of my pages are in sticky notes
URLS for admin pages are in github notes
